## Lesson Description

Build your Python data science skills. First, you’ll learn about iterators, objects you have
already encountered in the context of for loops. You’ll then learn about list comprehensions,
which are extremely handy tools for all data scientists working in Python. You’ll end the course
by working through a case study in which you’ll apply all the techniques you learned in both
parts of this course.

## Lesson Objectives

- Construct iterators
- Create lists
- Use iterators and lists in a real-world dataset
