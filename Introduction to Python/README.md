## Lesson Description

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data science. Companies worldwide are using Python 
to harvest insights from their data and gain a competitive edge. You will learn about powerful ways to store and manipulate data, 
and helpful data science tools to begin conducting your own analyses.

## Learning Objectives

- Use Python interactively
- Recognise Pythonâ€™s basic data types
- Able to store, access and manipulate data in lists
- Able to use functions, methods and packages appropriately
