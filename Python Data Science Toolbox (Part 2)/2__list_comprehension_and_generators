# List Comprehension and Generators

## List comprehensions

We have previously learnt to use `for` loops to populate lists. In this scenario, we
want to create a new list from an old list of numbers, and increase their values by 1.

```python
  nums = [1, 2, 3]
  new_nums = []

  for num in nums:
      new_nums.append(num + 1)

  print(new_nums)
```

```console
  [2, 3, 4]
```

However, `for` loops are "inefficient" as compared to using list comprehension, which
is faster and neater.

Here's how to use it:

1. Set up square brackets `[]`
2. Within the square brackets,
