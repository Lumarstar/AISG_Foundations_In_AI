course.

## Lesson Description

A vital component of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready
for analysis. It is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and
manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This course will equip you
with all the skills you need to clean your data in Python, from learning how to diagnose
problems in your data, to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course,
you’ll apply all of the techniques you’ve learned to a case study to clean a real-world
Gapminder dataset.

## Lesson Objectives

- Implement basic data cleaning techniques like removing missing values and duplicate rows
using Python
- Illustrate the principles of tidy data
- Demonstrate ability to combine datasets or clean each dataset separately
- Use string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data
